Abstraction:
    This program defines classes for "Video" and "Comment" to save information about YouTube videos and their comments. 
    By creates a list of videos, sets their attributes, and displays details for each video in the list.
Encapsulation:
    This program defines classes for "Order," "Product," "Customer," and "Address" to model an online ordering system. 
    The program calculates the total cost of order, generates packing and shipping labels, and displays relevant information for at least two orders with each products . 
    The classes apply encapsulation with private member variables, getters, setters, and appropriate methods to reach these functionalities.
Inheritance:
    This program apply inheritance for event planning system, with a base "Event" class and derived classes for specific event types. 
    It ensures encapsulation, avoids code duplication, and generates marketing messages for different events, including lectures, receptions, and outdoor gatherings.
Polymorphism:
    This program apply polymorphism, using a base "Activity" class and get classes for running, cycling, and swimming. 
    It calculates and displays activity summaries, avoiding code duplication through inheritance and method overriding while adhering to encapsulation principles.
